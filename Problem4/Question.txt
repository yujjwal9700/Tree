Discussed To approach

solution1.cpp
It contains the iterative approach where I basically used the queue data structure to store all the nodes which are at the same level


solution2.cpp
It contains the recursive approach. Basically Perfomed the Preorder traversal and maintain a variable to which store that to which level the particular node belongs to
